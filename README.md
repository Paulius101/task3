# CredoID user list task

This is a simple Angular web application that displays user list fetched from _Credo ID_ service using REST API 

 ![Application](/ss.png)

Candidate should improve web applicaiton by:
* Fixing existing bugs if found
* Fetching user details using _Retrieve user_ endpoint (https://demo.credoid.com/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=User%20API%20documentation) and filing user details card with information after user is selected from the list.
* Making overall code improvements that follow basic angular guidelines

Good luck!
